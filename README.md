# music-performance-manager

Experimental semantic web based tool for managing live music performances.

Current status: new, not working

The idea: semi-automated monitoring of live performance set-up (computers, instruments, programs, files), evolving to support analysis, trouble-shooting and re-creation of performance set-ups.

Part of the EPSRC-funded FAST IMPACt project (grant	EP/L019981/1).

## Testing

For now, see musiccodes for some of the set-up for Karma tests (`npm test`) - needs Chrome and local (not global) install of Karma (but that is a problem with links on Windows)

Run the server as
```
node server.js
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
